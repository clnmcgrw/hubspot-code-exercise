## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

- make years a 2-handled range slider 

- fuzzy-mathcing search (with a library)

- Could have authored cta.js in a way that works for multiple cta's on a page.  When working on a project I'd make sure to ask questions and get the full requirenments before I build anything. 

- set up linting for Sass & JS

- don't really need Babel polyfill, def shouldn't need half mb of script



## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?
